        firstDesc="The Nature Aquarium style originated in Japan and was pioneered by aquarist and landscape photographer, Takashi Amano.  Mr. Amano combined his many years of nature study and cultural background of refined Japanese aesthetics to create an aquarium design that resonates with natural energy and artistic expression.  A Nature Aquarium is an art form and a living ecosystem.  Nature Aquariums combine stylish aquarium equipment with layouts of wood, stone, living plants and fish to create an enchantment that is not soon forgotten."
        secondDesc="Aquarium Zen is one of the few tropical fish stores in the world focused on the Nature Aquarium style.  Our showroom in Seattle has all the supplies, equipment and knowledge necessary to help you create and maintain one of these living pieces of art in your own home or office."
